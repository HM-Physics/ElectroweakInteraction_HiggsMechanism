# ElectroweakInteraction_HiggsMechanism

## Overview
This Mathematica code implements physical calculations related to electroweak interaction theory and the Higgs mechanism. It uses gamma matrices, Pauli matrices, and left/right-handed fields to calculate the masses of gauge bosons (W, Z).

## Features
- Definition of 4×4 gamma matrices and verification of anti-commutation relations
- Implementation of Pauli matrices for bosons
- Handling of left-handed and right-handed fermion fields
- Calculations of electroweak interactions
- Derivation of W± and Z boson masses

## File Structure
- `ElectroweakInteraction_HiggsMechanism.nb`: Mathematica notebook file
- `ElectroweakInteraction_HiggsMechanism.pdf`: PDF file containing execution results

## Usage
1. Open the `.nb` file on a system with Mathematica installed
2. Evaluate the entire notebook or execute cell by cell
3. You can modify parameters (such as coupling constants) to explore different physical scenarios

## Theoretical Background
This code is based on the electroweak unification theory of the Standard Model. It mathematically calculates the process by which W± and Z bosons acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism. It uses the experimental value of the weak mixing angle (Weinberg angle) (sin²θw = 0.2276) to derive physical masses.

## Calculation Results
This code generates the following calculation results consistent with experimental values:
- W boson mass
- Z boson mass
- Verification of electromagnetic interactions

## Notes
This code is intended for educational and research purposes. Experimental values may have been updated, so it is recommended to refer to the latest physical constants.
